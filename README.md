# 👋 Hey, I'm Mohit
<br>

I build **reliable backend systems**, **high-performance microservices**, and **cloud-ready architectures** that scale.  
With **10+ years** in product engineering, I’ve worked across **Java ecosystems**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud platforms**, helping teams ship clean, maintainable, and impactful code.

Currently working as a **Staff Software Engineer**, where I:
- Design and optimize **Spring Boot + Microservices** architectures
- Dockerize and orchestrate workloads with **Kubernetes**
- Build event-driven systems powered by **Apache Kafka**
- Mentor, lead, and *grow* engineering teams the right way

I care deeply about **good engineering** — not just getting things done, but getting them done *well.*
